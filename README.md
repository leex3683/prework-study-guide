# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Motivations, reason for building, what was learned: This Website was created as an exercise to learn different coding languages (specifically, HTML, CSS, and JS), and to build familiarity with GitHub workflow, but also has the dual purpose of acting as study guide (a cheat sheet of sorts). 

Problems solved: As a student in a coding bootcamp, I'm often on different computers, so it helps to have my notes somewhere where I can access them from any machine.

## Usage

As stated in the description, this website was built to be used as a cheat sheet. The page is broken into four parts: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Find commonly used code under the language you're trying to code in. If you wish to use this page to memorize and study, there is also a randomizer you can run in the console to help you decide which language to study during your study session. Simply open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), and you'll find a random topic to study under the console comment "Which topic should we study first?"
